* Code in Sdk/Muine and Muine/ should be heavily refactored and moved to a suitable namespace.

* Most of public static objects in AppContext should be hidden. AppContext should only contain
things that cannot/should not use the Bus arch. Decoupling the different pieces of Muine should
be posible using this technique.

* All ui elements should be moved out of the Sdk. glade/ErrorDialog.glade should not be there.

* Things have been layed out and fixed pretty quick to start testing. Rearchitect the Sdk.

* Some player and playlist logic is handled inside the user interface code. Maybe we should have a Playlist class
asociated with the player and encapsulate the logic inside those types to reuse them.
