INSTALL
--------
Copy xchat_popup.py to the XChat user dir (/home/user/.xchat2). Restart XChat if it was open.

USING
------
The script shows a popup and a notification area icon on the following events:

* Someone sends us a private message.
* We connect to a new IRC server.
* We leave or join a channel.
* The topic changes.
* When someone types our nick in the channel.

This notifications can be activated or deactivated using the following xchat commands:
/setprivatenotify   value (value is 0 or 1)
/setconnectnotify   value (value is 0 or 1)
/setprivatenotify   value (value is 0 or 1)
/setjoinnotify	    value (value is 0 or 1)
/setnicknotify	    value (value is 0 or 1)

If "setnicknotify" is 0, when a user types our nick in the channel the script 
will only show a notification if the user who says our nick is included in a special list.
To add or remove users to this list use:

/addusernotify	    nick
/removeusernotify   nick
