chicken for Debian
------------------

This package does not depend on debian mono packages, as current mono packages are only
available in Debian Sid/Testing and only in a few architecture. For example, they are not 
present in Ubuntu. This will make installing this package possible where mono is not available
as a system package, but you will need mono >= 1.0, gtk-sharp >= 1.0 and gecko-sharp >= 0.5 installed
if you want to use this library.

*******
WARNING
*******
mono >= 1.0
gtk-sharp >= 1.0
gecko-sharp >= 0.5
monodoc >= 1.0

MUST be installed in your system.
