* Muine.Sdk.Data: abstract data types and Db services.

* Muine.Sdk.Configuration: Basic configuration logic for the framework. Currently I am using Nini (http://nini.sf.net) to keep the config in a .ini file. We could write a Nini backend to use gconf if we want. Although i think it is not necessary ATM.

* Muine.Sdk.Player: player services.

* Muine.Sdk.Playlist: playlist services.

* Muine.Sdk.Services: basic logic to load the kits and so on.
