DidiWiki 0.4
==============

DidiWiki is a small and simple WikiWikiWeb implementation written in
C. Its intended for personal use for notes, Todo's etc. It includes its
own webserver and hopefully its as simple as just compiling, running
and pointing your browser at it. 

Installation
============

To build do the usage ./configure and make. You can then make install or
run DidiWiki right from the src dir. On startup it'll tell you the address
to point your browser at. You should then be ready to go. 

If upgrading from an earlier version its a good idea to delete
~/.didiwiki/DidiHelp before running so you get the latest version of
the help file.

Notes & Excuses
===============

- If you want to contribute, check the TODO !

- Pages are stored in ~/.didiwiki ( you can override this by setting 
  'DIDIWIKIHOME' env var to a valid path. ). You can add a styles.css 
  to this directory to override the 'inbuilt' stylesheet.

- The webserver part is heavily based on cvstrac's internal server,
  following the same kind of process;

  - Its a pretty simple lightweight forking server. 

  - These forked children are assumed to not be around for very long,
    thus no real attempt is made to free up memory. 

  - Its probably not very secure at all. !!PLEASE DONT RUN AS ROOT!!

- The code uses asprintf in a couple of places. I dont know how portable
  this is to non Linux systems. If its a problem to you Feel free to send 
  patches.

- You can debug segv's by running like 'didiwiki debug' which will not
  start the http server, it existing in a single process but expecting the
  http request on stdin. 

- The formatting style is very similar to that of kwiki's - I just like 
  kwiki :-)

- I wrote it in C as I've mostly forgotten Python, Perl etc 
  ( and I wanted it to fit easily on a PDA ).
