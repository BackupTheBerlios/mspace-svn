Notes
=====

Want to keep things simple,quick and useful. Didiwiki intended for personal
use - Notes, Todos, basic PIM etc - functionality should reflect that.

Keep deps lows, binary should just run - no dependance on external files. 
Should just work. 

Pending
=====

Apply Halski's '-' patch.


Stuff that would be nice to have
=====

- Auth
  - basic http auth 
    - set via user/pass in ~/.didiwiki/.htacess ?
  - Limit by IP

- Any secruity improvements in code. 

- RSS feed of changes / searches ?

- Simple REST uri like API for external getting/setting raw wiki pages
  - didiwiki:8000/api/get/PageName
  - didiwiki:8000/api/set/PageName?data
  - didiwiki:8000/api/search
  - didiwiki:8000/api/changes

- Rewrite Parser.
  - can be much faster but its not that slow atm. 
  - make generic, output text, docbook ( bloat - uneeded )
                   - REST api would make it easy to write other 
		     programs that did this. 

- Wikipedia style icons after external links etc ( done in css )
  - 'xxd' can convert pngs etc to c arrays useful for including
    small images in binary. 

- Also favicon.ico *DONE*, though better icon would be nice. 

- Improve serach.

- Interwiki style links ?



Stuff thats a little more out there
======

- metadata on pages / tagging / tagging by dates
  - used to build custom searchs, group stuff togeather
    - more PIM like. 
  - need to think more on this

- #include 'wikipage' style directive ?

- GTD tool, how would this work ?
